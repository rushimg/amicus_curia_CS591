------------------------------------

Files:

1) emails/emails -> contains all the emails split into individual emails

2) congress_memebers -> raw names of congress members as well as fuzzy matching and processed names of congress memebers

3) data_analysis -> output of KNN, LDA, and k-means clustering methods

4) data_analysis_scripts -> scripts to run KNN, LDA, and k-means clustering

5) Scripts:

basic_parser.py -> parses out to/from/subject etc fields from file
basic_parser_to_file.py -> same as above, but writes to file 
bill_names.py -> parse out bill names from emails
clean_rep_names.py -> clean representative names 
clean_rep_names2.py -> same as above with the bigs fixed
fuzz_org_names.py -> match organization names in emails
fuzz_rep_names.py -> match rep names in emails
get_govtrack.py -> pull data from govtrack
link_govtrack.py -> link govtrack data and emails data
link_govtrack_2.py -> same as above but with bugs fixed
split_files_on_by_email.py -> split original email files into individaul emails 


6) CSVs
bill_parsing_billtype: bills per email with full prefix name
bill_parsing: bills per email with abbreviated prefix name
basic_parsing: to/from/subject/congress/session per email
bill_parsing_link: bills per email in form that they can be looked up in the govtrack csv
govtrack.csv: data pulled from govtrack
govtrack_link.csv: data pulled from govtrack with key that links to bill_parsing_link file
reps_parsing: reps per email
orgs_parsing: orgs per email
knn* : k nearest neighbors results
clust*: k-means results
govtrack_link.csv and bill_parsing_link.csv are the files that I added today to link the bills per email and govtrack data.
